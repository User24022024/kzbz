## Set virtual environment(optional):
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Run locally with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Edit the names (optional):
Open .lyrid-definition and change the App and Module name, because this will override another applications with the same name in the platform.

Wait until the cloud platform to finish with the build and the default deployment.

## Start hacking:

Edit the routes at /entry/entry.py with your custom API. 

Add more middlewares or your business logic in there.
